# 1-health

## Code institute and learning people first assessment project.

Health is such an important subject for all individuals to discuss. Especially mental health which is a subject gaining serious awareness in the public eye for the last few years. The idea behind the creation of the website is providing a platform that brings together images plus clips and artistic quotes on mental, physical and nutrition health. General health contributes towards an individuals happiness and productivity in their daily lives personally and professionally. This site aims to act as an education tool plus act as a vehicle to learn more and improve users own general health.

## UX-

This website is designed for users who want to visit a site and learn more about the importance of mental, physical and nutritional health in a visual manner. The major substance of information in the website are the clips; the clips can vary from thirty seconds to sixty minutes. With the ultimate goal to push forward the discussion around health and inspire individuals to take control of their personal health. The site acts as a vehicle for users to look further into health via footer links and youtube clips.

Social media platforms such as instagram and snapchat has inspired the user experience for this website; use of minimal text and a combination of clips& images. The clips taken from youtube is the major focus of user experience.

* i. 
As a user I want to access each page with ease, so I can flow round the site without any issues. 
* ii. 
As a user I want to learn more about each health topic easily, so that I can become more educated on general health. 
* iii. 
As a user I want the content to stand out from the background, so that the site is easy to look at.

## Features, existing features and features left to implement

https://github.com/michodgs24/1-health/issues/1#issue-596106675

## Technologies-

* Wrote the code in git-pod. 
* The two primary languages used are HTML and CSS. 
* Applied semantic language structure employed Header, Nav, Section and Footer.
* Font-awesome version 5.8.1, this is important as this provided the styling to the footer section with four different icons. This contributes to achieving user satisfaction for the site to look easy to look at. 
* Applied bootstrap cdn version 4.4.1, the use of bootstrap is very important as this helped create a horizontal navigation bar. This looks to achieve user satisfaction to make the site easy to navigate.

## Testing-

### Testing - i.
Shared the link on google, internet explorer and yahoo to ensure the site looks and works as it should on different browers. 
### Testing - ii. 
On each brower changing the size of the browser to ensure the site maintained its structural integrity across different devices such as mobile or tablet. 
### Testing - iii. 
Logged into different devices and tested my site link; which worked as intended. 
### Testing - iiii. 
Shared site link to course mentor, whom confirmed the link worked as intended.

How the site looks on different mobile device screens was a major challenge of this project; especially having a horizontal menu bar. Using a bootstrap style collapse menu which was implemented to help users on mobile devices.

Unfortunately the menu once on mobile devices ends up vertically and very far left which affect user experiecne but is still usuable. Different screen sizes is major test of the structural integrity, different screen sizes were explored using google developer tools.

The content still flowed like it should down the page on mobile devices. But improvement can be made further with the content filling the screen and the naviagation bar shrinking to fit the which ever screen size it is on.

## Tested the site on different screen sizes: 

### iphone 5/SE - 
logo and navigation collapse vertically, navigation works as intended, clips collapse vertically but overlap to the right, images collapse vertically but overlap to the right, quote images collapse vertically and fit the screen but not centrally. Footer collapses vertically and links all work as intended. Text on nutrition, mental and Physical health pages, collapses centrally on the page.

### Galaxy S5 - 
Logo Pinned at the top of the page, navigation bar collapses far right of the page, clips collapse vertically but overlap to the right, images collapse vertically but overlap to the right, quote-image fit on the left and collapsed vertically. Footer collapses vertically and links all work as intended.

### Pixel 2 - 
Logo at top of the page on the left hand side, navigation bar is on the right collapsed vertically(Home aligned right of the logo), clips and images collapse vertically but fit centrally onto the page, quote-image fit on the left and collapsed vertically. Footer collapses vertically and links all work as intended.

### Pixel 2 XL-

### iPad - 
Logo is at the top of the left hand side of the page, navigation is slightly right overlapping, collapse vertically and fit the page to the left, text is horizontal but overlaps to the right, clips and images fit to the left of the page and collapse vertically. Quote images spread horizontally and overlap to the right, footer spreads horizontally but overlaps right.

### ipad Pro - 
Logo is at the top of the page, navigation spread horizontally to the right very close to the edge of the page, clips and images fit centrally down the page. Quote images spread horizontally down the center of the page. Footer also spread horizontally.

### Testing summary of device screens: 
The sites links and interactive media all works as intended, the logo stays in the same position across all screen sizes. Navigation is inconsistent, collapsing vertically most on mobile devices and spread horizontal on tablets. Clips and images- overlap to the right frequently occaisionally fitting centrally. Text maintains integrity across screen sizes but on larger screens such as the ipad Pro where the text overlaps to the right. Footer collapses vertically and fits the screen on the majority of screen sizes. On larger screen sizes the footer can be horizontal.

## Version control-

Version control was conducted through following consistent updates through git-pod to git-hub project page. 
* i. Git add. 
* ii. Git commit -m "insert message". 
* iii. Git Push that updates the existing files in git-hub.

## Deployment-

Deployed the site to github.

I ran my site locally by typing: python3 -m http.server in the terminal, open port 8000 and refresh the browser as initially the page does not load.

In deployed version on the site, the site looks how it should. The navigation bar, clips and footer links all work as intended.
