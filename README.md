# 1-health

Code institute and learning people first assessment project.

Health is such an important subject for all individuals to discuss. Especially mental health which is a subject gaining serious awareness in the public eye for the last few years. 
The idea behind the creation of the website is providing a platform that brings together images plus clips and artistic quotes on mental, physical and nutrition health.
General health contributes towards an individuals happiness and productivity in their daily lives personally and professional. 
This site aims to act as an education tool plus act as a vehicle to learn more and improve their own general health.


UX-

This website for users who want to visit a site and learn more about the importance of mental, physical and nutritional health in a visual manner. The major substance of information in the website is the clips; the clips can vary from thirty seconds to sixty minutes. With the ultimate goal to push forward the discussion around health and inspire individuals to take control of their personal health. The site acts as a vehicle for users to look further into health via footer links and youtube clips.

Social media platforms such as instagram and snapchat has inspired the user experience for this website; use of minimal text and a combination of clips& images. 
The clips taken from youtube is the major focus of user experience.

The Wireframe documents above allowed the designer(myself) to follow a mobile first approach prioritising the content that should be included on the site.

Features-

Logo on the far top left side of the page, with the menu/ navigation left-center horizontally below the logo/header. 
Three clips displayed horizontally aligned; three images directly below and clips are tailored to each particular health type. 
Then directly below the images/text are six different images with inspiring quotes around that health type.

In mental, physical and nutrition pages there are minimal texts that are taken from sites such as the British heart foundation and WHO (World health organisation. on those health subjects. 

Six quote-images on each page as inspiration to the viewer that relates the health subject in a short artistic manner. On each page is a footer that three links to external sites, for the viewer to visit and discover more about health.

Existing Features- 

The menu feature allows the user to move from home page, mental health, physical health and eat well pages. 
A navigation bar underneath the logo/header spread horizontally across the page; this allows the user to access each page seamlessly.
The clips feature brings the conversation the viewer in a entertaining and engaging manner, for example one clip features famous boxer/athlete Tyson Fury who is well known for his mental health issues and he talks openly about his mental health thus encourages others to do the same.
The footer feature allows users to investigate further on mental, physical and nutrition health.

Features left to implement- 

The conversation around health is constantly evolving; a blog or similar feature where users can input their own mental health experience. More clips to be inputted; clips are the primary substance of the site thus more verified footage that is engaging, the greater the substance of the website.

Technologies- 

Wrote the code in git-pod. The two primary languages used are HTML and CSS. Applied semantic language structure employed Header, Nav, Section and Footer. Applied bootstrap formatting to the menu section and font awesome design to the footer.

Testing - i. Shared the link on google, internet explorer and yahoo to ensure the site looks and works as it should on different browers. ii. On each brower changing the size of the browser to ensure the site maintained its structural integrity across different devices such as mobile or tablet.
Testing - ii. Logged into different devices and tested my site link; which worked as intended.
Testing - iii. Shared site link to course mentor, whom confirmed the link worked as intended.

How the site looks on different mobile device screens was a major challenge of this project; especially having a horizontal menu bar. Using a bootstrap style collapse menu which was implemented to help users on mobile devices. Unfortunately the menu once on mobile devices ends up vertically and very far left which affect user experiecne but is still usuable. Different screen sizes is major test of the structural integrity, different screen sizes were explored using google dev tools. The content still flowed like it should down the page on mobile devices. But improvement can be made further with the content filling the screen and the naviagation bar shrinking to fit the which ever screen size it is on.


Version control- 

Version control was conducted through following consistent updates through git-pod to git-hub project page.
i. Git add.
ii. Git commit -m "insert message".
iii. Git Push that updates the existing files in git-hub. 



Deployment-

Deployed the site to github.

I ran my site locally by typing: python3 -m http.server in the terminal, open port 8000 and refresh the browser as initially the page does not load.

Link to website on github - https://michodgs24.github.io/1-health/

In deployed version on the site, the site looks how it should. The navigation bar, clips and footer links all work as intended.
